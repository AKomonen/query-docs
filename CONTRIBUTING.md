### DAX Reference

The DAX Reference allows Quick edits by using the in-browser GitHub editor and more detailed edits by using Git and markdown tools.

### Power Query M Reference

The Power Query M function reference is mostly created through an automated process from in-product help. At this time, the Power Query M function reference does not allow Quick edits by using the in-browser GitHub editor.
