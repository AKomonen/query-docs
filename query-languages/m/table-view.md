# Table.View
<code>Table.View(<b>table</b> as nullable table, <b>handlers</b> as record) as table</code>

## About

Returns a view of <code>table</code> where the functions specified in <code>handlers</code> are used in lieu of the default behavior of an operation when the operation is applied to the view.
Handler functions are optional. If a handler function is not specified for an operation, the default behavior of the operation is applied to <code>table</code> instead (except in the case of <code>GetExpression</code>).

Handler functions must return a value that is semantically equivalent to the result of applying the operation against <code>table</code> (or the resulting view in the case of <code>GetExpression</code>).

If a handler function raises an error, the default behavior of the operation is applied to the view.

<code>Table.View</code> can be used to implement folding to a data source â€“ the translation of M queries into source-specific queries (e.g. to create T-SQL statements from M queries).

Please see the published documentation for a more complete description of <code>Table.View</code>.
