# DateTime.FixedLocalNow

## Syntax

<pre>
DateTime.FixedLocalNow() as datetime
</pre>
  
## About  
Returns a `datetime` value set to the current date and time on the system. This value is fixed and will not change with successive calls, unlike DateTime.LocalNow, which may return different values over the course of execution of an expression.
