# Value.ReplaceType

  
## About  
A value may be ascribed a type using Value.ReplaceType. Value.ReplaceType either returns a new value with the type ascribed or raises an error if the new type is incompatible with the valueâ€™s native primitive type. In particular, the function raises an error when an attempt is made to ascribe an abstract type, such as any.  When replacing a the type of a record, the new type must have the same number of fields, and the new fields replace the old fields by ordinal position, not by name.  Similarly, when replacing the type of a table, the new type must have the same number of columns, and the new columns replace the old columns by ordinal position.
