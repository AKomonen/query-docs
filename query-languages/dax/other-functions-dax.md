|[SELECTEDSMEASURE](selectedmeasure-function-dax.md) |   Used by expressions for calculation items to reference the measure that is in context.   |
|[SELECTEDSMEASURENAME](selectedmeasurename-function-dax.md) |   Used by expressions for calculation items to determine the measure that is in context by name.   |
|[SUMMARIZECOLUMNS](summarizecolumns-function-dax.md)      |  Returns a summary table over a set of groups.        |
